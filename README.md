# Getting Started with Web Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Create my-app

Before installing source files make sure that Node and npm is installed. After that create folder for app. In this folder run:

### `npx create-react-app my-app`

It downloads necessary nodes for the web page. Additionally make sure that you have installed react-router-dom:

### `npm install react-router-dom`

After that download this source code and replace files in /src and /public with the ones in this project. After this you are
ready to run the web page locally with: 

### `npm start`

This opens the webpage in locally in address http://localhost:3000/
